# Facial Attendance Monitoring System
 FAMS is a biometric-based desktop application developed using Python and Tkinter that automates atten
dance tracking using face recognition. This system eliminates the need for traditional attendance methods,
 such as manual registers, improving accuracy, security, and efficiency. The architecture includes:<br><br>
<b>Frontend (GUI):</b> 
Tkinter is used for the user interface, where users can input data and interact
with the application.<br>
<b>Backend (Database): </b>
Using CSV files we will store user information and also their Facial data<br>
<b>Application Logic: </b>
Using KNN and LBPH algorithms the face is recognized and attendance is marked at the backend with timestamp<br>
